.SH NAME
awesome \- awesome window manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B awesome
.RB [ \-v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
awesome is a window manager for X. It manages windows in tiled and
floating layouts. Either layout can be applied dynamically, optimizing the
environment for the application in use and the task performed.
.P
In tiled layout windows are managed in a master and stacking area. The master
area contains windows which currently needs most attention, whereas the
stacking area contains all other windows. In floating layout windows can be
resized and moved freely. Dialog windows are always managed floating,
regardless of the layout applied.
.P
Windows are grouped by tags. Each window can be tagged with one or multiple
tags. Selecting certain tags displays all windows with these tags.
.P
awesome contains a small status bar which displays all available tags, the layout,
the title of the focused window, and the text read from standard input. A
floating window is indicated with an empty square and a maximized
floating window is indicated with a filled square before the windows
title. The selected tags are indicated with a different color. The tags of
the focused window are indicated with a filled square in the top left
corner. The tags which are applied to one or more windows are indicated
with an empty square in the top left corner.
.P
awesome can draw a small border around windows to indicate the focus state.

.SH SEE ALSO
.BR dmenu (1)
.SH BUGS
The status bar may display
.BR "EOF"
when awesome has been started by an X session manager like
.BR xdm (1),
because those close standard output before executing awesome.
.P
Java applications which use the XToolkit/XAWT backend may draw grey windows
only. The XToolkit/XAWT backend breaks ICCCM-compliance in recent JDK 1.5 and early
JDK 1.6 versions, because it assumes a reparenting window manager. As a workaround
you can use JDK 1.4 (which doesn't contain the XToolkit/XAWT backend) or you
can set the following environment variable (to use the older Motif
backend instead):
.BR AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit .
.P
Recent GTK 2.10.9+ versions contain a broken
.BR Save\-As
file dialog implementation,
which requests to reconfigure its window size in an endless loop. However, its
window is still respondable during this state, so you can simply ignore the flicker
until a new GTK version appears, which will fix this bug, approximately
GTK 2.10.12+ versions.
