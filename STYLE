If you intend to patch and contribute awesome, please respect the following coding style:
- Use 4 space tabs instead of tabs;
- Place braces alone on new lines;
- No space before if, for, while statements or function call;
- The preferred line length is 80 characters;
- Be clear in what you do.

A vim modeline is set in each file to respect this.
