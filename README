awesome
=======
awesome is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

Requirements
------------
In order to build awesome itself, you need header files and libs of:
  - cmake 2.6
  - Xlib, xcb and xcb-util (>= 0.3.0)
  - Lua 5.1
  - cairo
  - pango and pangocairo
  - libev
  - glib
  - Imlib2 or GdkPixBuf (use -DWITH_IMLIB2=OFF with cmake)
  - dbus (optional, use -DWITH_DBUS=OFF with cmake to disable)
  - gperf

In order to build the awesome man pages and documentation,
you need these tools:
  - asciidoc
  - xmlto
  - docbook XSL stylesheets
  - luadoc

In order to build the source code reference, you need these tools:
  - doxygen
  - graphviz

Building and installation
-------------------------
After extracting the dist tarball, run:

  make

This will create a build directory, run cmake in it and build awesome.

After the building done, you can type this to install:

  make install # might need root permissions

Running awesome
---------------
You can directly select awesome from your display manager. If not, you can
add the following line to your .xinitrc to start awesome using startx
or to .xsession to start awesome using your display manager:

    exec awesome

In order to connect awesome to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec awesome

(This will start awesome on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

Configuration
-------------
The configuration of awesome is done by creating a $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/awesome/rc.lua file.
An example is provided in the sources.

Troubleshooting
---------------
In most systems any message printed by awesome (including warnings and errors)
are written to $HOME/.xsession-errors.

If awesome does not start or the configuration file is not producing the desired
results the user should examine this file to gain insight into the problem.
