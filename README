jdwm - Julien's dynamic window manager
============================
jdwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.
It's based on dwm.

Requirements
------------
In order to build jdwm you need the Xlib header files and libconfig.

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (jdwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install jdwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

Running jdwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start jdwm using startx
or to .xsession to start jdwm using gdm/kdm/xdm...:

    exec jdwm

In order to connect jdwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec jdwm

(This will start jdwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while true
    do
        echo `date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`
        sleep 1
    done | jdwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of jdwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
