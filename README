awesome
=======
awesome is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.
It's based on dwm.

Requirements
------------

In order to build awesome you need the Xlib header files, libconfuse and cairo.
Creating the man pages also requires recent versions of the asciidoc and xmlto
tools.

Installation
------------
If building from git sources, run "autoreconf -vis .". When autoreconf has
finished, you can follow the following instructions for building a dist
tarball.

After extracting the dist tarball, run "./configure --help" and figure out
what you might want to adapt for your system. Then run ./configure with the
proper parameters, and build and install:

  ./configure [...]
  make
  make install # might need root permissions

If you're using gcc as your compiler and do not want awesome's default set
of warning flags, add AWESOME_CFLAGS="" to your "make" lines.

Running awesome
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start awesome using startx
or to .xsession to start awesome using gdm/kdm/xdm...:

    exec awesome

In order to connect awesome to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec awesome

(This will start awesome on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

Configuration
-------------
The configuration of awesome is done by creating a ~/.awesomerc file.
An example is provided in the sources.
