In order to build the awesome man pages and documentation,
you need these tools:

  - docbook XSL stylesheets
  - luadoc

In order to build the source code reference, you need these tools:

  - graphviz

Building and Installation
-------------------------
After extracting the dist tarball, run:

  cmake .
  make

The source code reference can be built with "make doc".

Running awesome
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start awesome using startx
or to .xsession to start awesome using gdm/kdm/xdm...:

the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec awesome

(This will start awesome on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)
